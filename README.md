# FIX-MYIIT-MASTER
Master Repo for Project 2


Self-Critique: I have tried my best to how much I am. I am still learning and will continue to lean as much as I can. This class was fun taking and I enjoyed working with all the different type of labs and projects which helped me to develop more skills into it. I never thought that we tried to keep our myiit portal as simple as we can.I contributed with HTML code which I told in my group about coding in html and i tried my best. I think everthing went in so quick that i was not able to react to what was happening. But I am thankful to professor for being so good to me and teaching web designing skills throughout summer and fall. 

My team was never perfect. There were some misscommunication which led to some confusion and resulted in some problem later on. Our team was never full and therefore we were short staffed and was not able to complete everything. But due to confusion, I cant blame any of my team memebers, and most importantly there was no trust between each other and therefore ending is really bad. Overall me and my team did well and we gave our best. all the best to my team mates for future and hope you acheive great height. ALl the best for the professor and you have been such a great professor.
